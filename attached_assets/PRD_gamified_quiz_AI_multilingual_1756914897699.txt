Gamified Quiz Platform (India-first) — Product Requirement Document (PRD)

1) PRODUCT OVERVIEW
A real-time, gamified quiz platform for working professionals and students. Delivers engaging knowledge checks, live competitions, and actionable insights. Adds an AI Quiz Builder that generates questions from PDF/Word uploads, URLs, or pasted text. Designed for India-first use: mobile-first, low-bandwidth, and multilingual (English + Indian languages).

Purpose
• Increase learning engagement with game mechanics (confetti, streaks, team play) while keeping a professional option (minimal mode). 
• Reduce time-to-create via AI-assisted question generation and a reusable question bank.
• Provide fair modes (accuracy-first, speed-optional) responding to complaints about “fastest finger” bias.
• Offer transparent pricing and generous free capacity (addressing price/cap frustration).

— Research rationale: Users complain about restrictive free tiers and player caps; students report “quiz fatigue” and overemphasis on speed; professionals want a less kiddish tone and simple joining (QR/code).

2) TARGET AUDIENCE
Primary
• Working professionals (L&D, trainers, team leads): need polished hosting, team/co-op modes, analytics, CSV export, and brandable tone. 
• Students (classes, clubs, coaching): want colorful, fun, low-friction join, instant feedback, and low data usage.

Secondary
• Teachers/lecturers/tutors: quick authoring (AI), reusable content, and control over speed vs. accuracy. 
• Event hosts/communities: large live rooms, easy QR join, simple moderation.

Key needs to satisfy
• Easy content creation (AI from docs/URL/text). • Low ceremony join (PIN/QR, no account for participants). • Flexible scoring beyond speed. • Works great on Indian mobile networks/devices. • Multilingual UI/content.

3) CORE FEATURES (3)
A) AI QUIZ BUILDER (Docs/URL/Text → Questions)
• Upload PDF/Word, paste URL or text; extract content; generate MCQ/True/False/Short Answer/Poll questions with suggested answers and difficulty tags.
• Provide source citations (page/URL) for each generated item; allow human edit/approve; save to quiz/question bank.
• Safety & quality: de-duplication, profanity filter, hallucination check (reject if confidence low); support topic/keyword prompts.
— Justification: Creation time is a major pain; users want import/generation and question banks.

B) LIVE GAME ENGINE (Host & Play)
• Host creates session → session code + QR. Players join on mobile via code/QR (no login required for players).
• Modes: Speed (classic), Accuracy (scores correctness over speed), Team/Co-op (aggregate scores; optional shared lifelines). 
• Engagement: confetti on correct, streak bonuses (3/5+), countdown animations, sound cues with mute toggle; anti-spam (one answer/question), host controls (start/pause/next/end).
— Justification: Overemphasis on speed is a common complaint; teams/co-op and richer feedback sustain engagement without fatigue.

C) INSIGHTS, LOCALIZATION & EXPORTS
• Results/leaderboard: per-player score, streaks; per-question accuracy/time; CSV export.
• Multilingual UI (English + Hindi at MVP; add 2+ regional languages soon after). Support quiz content translation workflow (human review).
• Low-bandwidth design: lightweight pages, image compression, progressive loading; PWA basics for repeat play.
— Justification: Professionals need analytics/exports; Indian users need language support and reliable mobile performance.

5) DESIGN GUIDELINES (UI/UX & Visual)
Principles
• Mobile-first: thumb-friendly buttons, large tap targets, minimal input fields.
• Join in ≤ 5 seconds: QR + short code; no accounts for players.
• Clear hierarchy: professional host UI (minimal, brandable); playful player UI (color, confetti) with “mute/minimal mode.”
• Performance: compressed assets, skeleton loading, no blocking modals during play; resilient to network drops.
• Accessibility & Languages: switch UI language at any time; store locale in profile; clear fonts with high contrast; dyslexia-friendly option.

Visual Direction
• Two themes: Playful (students) and Minimal (professionals). Colorful gradients and micro-animations for players; subdued palette for host. Confetti and streak animations are short and optional.

Content & Language
• All UI copy routed through i18n; translation files for en/hi at MVP. Content translation workflow: AI-suggested translation → human review before publish.

Implementation Notes (brief)
• Stack: Next.js + Supabase (Auth, DB, Realtime, Storage). i18n with JSON dictionaries; language toggle in header.
• AI pipeline (service): extract text (PDF/Doc parser), chunk, prompt LLM to propose questions+answers+explanations with source mapping; de-dup; confidence scoring; moderation.
• Fairness: scoring modes selectable; default to Accuracy for classrooms; Speed optional for games.
• Data privacy: do not retain uploaded documents after quiz creation unless user opts in (GDPR-friendly); show “source used” list in quiz editor.
